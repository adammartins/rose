    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

      <p>This part of the Rose user guide walks you through using the <a href=
      "rose-rug-task-run.html#rose-task-run.util.rose_bunch">Rose Bunch</a>
      built in app.</p>

      <p>This allows multiple variants of a command to be run under a single
      job.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

      <p>Often, we want to run many instances of a command that differ only
      slightly from each other at the same time - an example would be where a
      command is run repeatedly with only its arguments changing.</p>

      <p>Rather than creating multiple apps or optional configs to change the
      way a command is to be run, we can instead use the built-in <var>rose
      bunch</var> application to run multiple command variants, in parallel,
      under a single job as defined by an application configuration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="warning">Warning</h2>

      <p>It is important to note that when running your <var>rose bunch</var>
      app under load balancing systems such as PBS or Slurm, you will need to
      set resource requests to reflect the resources required by running
      multiple commands at once.</p>

      <p>For example, if a single command would require 1GB memory and the app
      is configured to run up to 4 commands at once then 4GB of memory should
      be requested.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example-task">Example</h2>

      <p>In this example we are going to create a suite that simulates the
      handling of landing planes at an airport. For a given plane the process
      of landing and unloading is the same: land, taxi to the terminal, unload
      passengers and get clear. We can refer to this as the "landing" routine.
      What differs between landings is the plane type, number of passengers
      carried and the resulting timings for each stage of the landing
      process.</p>

      <p>Create a <a href="rose-rug-brief-tour#cli">new suite</a> (or just a
      new directory somewhere - e.g. in your homespace) containing a blank
      <samp>rose-suite.conf</samp> and a <samp>suite.rc</samp> file that looks
      like this:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example suite.rc</h3>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[cylc]
    UTC mode = True # Ignore DST
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = lander
[runtime]
    [[root]]
        script = rose task-run
    [[lander]]
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example App</h3>

      <p>In the suite directory create an <samp>app/</samp> directory</p>
      <pre class="shell">
mkdir app
</pre>

      <p>In the <var>app</var> directory create a <var>lander/</var>
      directory</p>
      <pre class="shell">
cd app
mkdir lander
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example App (2)</h3>

      <p>In the <var>app/lander/</var> directory create a
      <samp>rose-app.conf</samp> file using your editor of choice and paste the
      following lines into it:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
mode=rose_bunch

[bunch]
command-format=land %(class)s %(passengers)s

[bunch-args]
class=airbus concorde airbus cessna
passengers=40 20 30 2
</pre>

      <p>This configuration will run a <code>rose bunch</code> task that calls
      multiple instances of the <code>land</code> command, supplying arguments
      to each instance from the <var>class</var> and <var>passengers</var>
      entries under <var>[bunch-args]</var>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example App (3)</h3>

      <p>In the <var>app/lander/</var> directory create a <samp>bin/</samp>
      directory:</p>
      <pre class="shell">
mkdir bin
</pre>

      <p>Using your editor of choice, create a file named "land" under the bin
      directory and paste in <a href=
      "etc/rose-rug-advanced-tutorials-rose-bunch/src/land.html">these</a>
      lines. This script capures the landing routine and expects two arguments;
      the plane type (its class) and the number of passengers it is
      carrying.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example App (4)</h3>

      <p>Finally, make the new <samp>land</samp> file executable by navigating
      into the bin directory of the <samp>lander</samp> app and running:</p>
      <pre class="shell">
chmod +x land
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Run Example</h3>

      <p>Navigate to the top directory of your suite (where the
      <samp>suite.rc</samp> and <samp>rose-suite.conf</samp> files can be
      found) and run <samp>rose suite-run</samp>. Your suite should run, launch
      the cylc gui and successfully run the lander app.</p>

      <p>Once the suite has finished running and has shutdown, open <samp>rose
      bush</samp> to view its output (note that you can close the cylc gui at
      this point). You can quickly get to the relevent page by running
      <samp>rose slv</samp> from within the suite directory.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
    <h3 class="alwayshidden">Examine output</h3>

    <p>In the <samp>rose bush</samp> jobs page for your suite you should be
    presented with a page containing a single row for the <samp>lander</samp>
    task, from which you can access its output. In that row you should see
    something like this:</p><img src="rose-bunch-rose-bush-view.png" width=
    "100%" alt="rose bush view of output"/></div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Examine output (2)</h3>

      <p>In the <samp>rose bush</samp> entry you should see that the usual
      links are present for the task such as for <var>job.out</var>,
      <var>job.status</var> etc. with the addition of two drop down boxes: one
      for <var>bunch.*.err</var> and one for <var>bunch.*.out</var>. Rather
      than mixing the outputs from the multiple command invocations being run
      at once, <samp>rose bunch</samp> directs their output to individual
      output files. So, for example, the ouput from running the command with
      the first set of parameters can be found in the <var>bunch.0.out</var>
      file, the second set in the <var>bunch.1.out</var> file etc. Examine
      these output files now to confirm that all four of the args combinations
      have been run and produced output.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="naming-invocations">Naming invocations</h2>

      <p>While the different invocations of the command have their own output
      directed to indexed files, it can sometimes be difficult to quickly
      identify which file to look in for output. To aid this, <code>rose
      bunch</code> supports naming command instances via the
      <code>[bunch]name=</code> option.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Naming invocations (2)</h3>

      <p>Open your app config (under <var>app/lander/rose-app.conf</var>) and
      add the following line under the <code>[bunch]</code> section:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
names=BA123 Emirates345 BA007 PC456
</pre>

      <p>Re-run your suite and, once it has finished, open up <var>rose
      bush</var> and examine the job listing. In the drop-down
      <var>bunch.*.err</var> and <var>bunch.*.out</var> boxes you should now
      see entries for the names you've configured rather than the
      <var>bunch.0.out ... bunch.3.out</var> entries previously present.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="limits">Limiting concurrent invocations</h2>

      <p>In some situations we may need to limit the number of concurrently
      running command invocations - often as a result of resource limitations.
      Rather than batching up jobs into sets of <var>N</var> simultaneously
      running commands, <code>rose bunch</code> apps can be configured to run
      as many commands as possible within some limit i.e. while <var>N</var>
      commands are running, if one of them finishes, don't wait for the
      remaining <var>N-1</var> jobs to finish before running the
      <var>N+1</var>th one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Limiting concurrent invocations (2)</h3>

      <p>In the case of our simulated airport we will pretend we only have two
      runways available at a time on which our planes can land. As such we need
      to limit the number of planes being landed. We do this using the
      <code>[bunch]pool-size=</code> configuration option of the <code>rose
      bunch</code> app.</p>

      <p>Open your app config (under <var>app/lander/rose-app.conf</var>) and
      add the following line to the <code>[bunch]</code> section:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
pool-size=2
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Limiting concurrent invocations (3)</h3>

      <p>Run your suite again. Notice that this time round it takes longer for
      the task to run as it has been limited in the number of command variants
      it can run simultaneously. You can see the individual commands being
      started by viewing the task stdout in the cylc gui by right clicking on
      the task and selecting "View" then "job stdout". As an example, when the
      "BA007" invocation starts running you should see the line:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-cylc">
[INFO] BA007: added to pool
</pre>

      <p>appear in the job output after a while whereas, when running without a
      pool-size, the line will appear pretty quickly.</p>

      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

      <p>In this tutorial we have learnt how to configure a <var>rose
      bunch</var> app to run a set of command variants under one job. We have
      learnt how to name the individual variants for convenience in examining
      the logs and how to limit the number of concurrently running
      commands.</p>

      <p>Further options are listed in the <code>rose bunch</code> <a href=
      "rose-rug-task-run.html#rose-task-run.util.rose_bunch">documentation</a>.
      These include, configuring how to proceed following failure of an
      individual command invocation - <code>[bunch]fail-mode=</code>),
      automatically generating <var>N</var> <code>command-instances</code> and
      enabling/disabling the app's incremental mode etc.</p>
